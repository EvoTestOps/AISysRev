# AISysRev
This tool offers AI-based support for Systematic Literature Reviews. Currently, only one step is supported: title–abstract screening. Please cite our research papers on this topic if you use the tool [1–2].

## Getting started

First, clone the repository to your local computer.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvoTestOps/TitleAbstractScreening.git
```
### Data
The tool has been tested with CSV data exported from [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/).
The minimum required fields are: Document title, DOI, Abstract, Authors (?), and Source title(?). 

Note: Exporting additional fields, such as Year, may result in an error.

### LLMs Access and LLM screening speed
The tool is integrated with OpenRouter, which supports multiple LLMs ranging from very affordable to top-tier models. To use the tool, you need to provide an OpenRouter key. You can set spending limits for each key directly on the OpenRouter website. New users also receive $5 in free credits when creating an account.

Note: Paper screening speed is about 4,5s per paper. 


### System and software requirements
- Docker, with Compose plugin installed
- Enough RAM (8GB) to run multiple containers
- Network connection

See [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) for Docker installation instructions. **Docker Desktop includes Docker Compose, Docker Engine and the Docker CLI.**

1. Run `docker info` to verify you have Docker installed
   - Docker `26.0.0` has been tested as working. For MacOS computers, Colima has been rigorously tested to work.
3. Run `docker compose version` to verify you have Compose installed.
   - Version `2.33.1` has been tested as working, newer versions should also work.
   - **Note:** Older versions of Compose use `docker-compose` as the compose command. We don't provide support for legacy Compose versions.


### Running the application

#### MacOS, Linux and Windows (WSL)

`make start-prod` should start the stack, assuming you have the requirements met. The start up may take up to 3 minutes to start due to installation and downloading of necessary components. 

#### Windows (non-WSL)

`./start-prod.bat` should start the stack for non-WSL Windows operating systems.

## Technology

### Front-end

TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Wouter, Zod, Redux

### Back-end

Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic

## Development requirements
- Node.js v22 LTS
- Python 3.9
- Docker, with Compose plugin installed

## Running in development mode

### MacOS, Linux and Windows (WSL)

`make start-dev`

### Windows (non-WSL)

`./start-dev.bat`

### Getting started with development

Open up the client: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

`/api` is proxied to the backend container, e.g. `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health` will be proxied to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health`.

API docs: [http://localhost:3000/documentation](http://localhost:3000/docs)

Server: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:3000)

Adminer GUI: [http://localhost:8081/?pgsql=postgres&username=your_username&db=your_database_dev&ns=][http://localhost:8081/?pgsql=postgres&username=your_username&db=your_database_dev&ns=] password: **your_password**

## Mock data

Mock data is located in `data/mock` -folder.

## Tests

Run in [client/](./client/) `npm test` for e2e tests

Run in root `make backend-test` (`./backend-test.bat` for Windows non-WSL) for backend tests

Run in root `make backend-test-html` (`./backend-test-html.bat` for Windows non-WSL) for backend tests and HTML coverage report

## Makefile Commands

The project includes a `Makefile` for common development and database operations:

### Development

| Command           | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make start-dev`  | Start dev containers with live reloading and build on startup (default setup) |
| `make start-test` | Start test containers and rebuild images (isolated test environment)          |
| `make start-prod` | Start production container and rebuild images                                 |

> **Note:** Run all commands from the project root.  
> Containers are isolated by environment using the Docker Compose `-p` flag.

### Database Migrations (Alembic)

| Command                     | Description                                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make m-create m="Message"` | Create a new migration with an autogenerated diff (replace `Message`) |
| `make m-up`                 | Apply all pending migrations (upgrade to latest)                      |
| `make m-hist`               | Show the full migration history with details                          |
| `make m-current`            | Display the current migration version in the database                 |

## Supported LLMs

Currently, we support models provided via Openrouter.
