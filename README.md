# AI-automated screening PoC

## Introduction

This proof-of-concept (PoC) application demonstrates the current capabilities of AI-automated title-abstract screening of systematic reviews (SRs). This PoC is based on a conference paper "The Promise and Challenges of Using LLMs to Accelerate the Screening Process of Systematic Reviews" by Huotala et al.

## Technology

### Front-end

TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Wouter, Zod, Redux

### Back-end

Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic

## Requirements

Node.js v22 LTS and Python 3.9 are required.

## Running in development mode

Run `make start-dev`

Open up the client: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

`/api` is proxied to the backend container, e.g. `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health` will be proxied to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health`.

API docs: [http://localhost:3000/documentation](http://localhost:3000/docs)

Server: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:3000)

## Running in production mode

Run `make start-prod`

## Mock data

Mock data is located in `data/mock` -folder.

## Tests

Run `npm test` for e2e tests in [client/](./client/)

Run `make backend-test` for backend tests in root

## Makefile Commands

The project includes a `Makefile` for common development and database operations:

### Development

| Command         | Description                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `make start-dev` | Start dev containers with live reloading and build on startup (default setup) |
| `make start-test` | Start test containers and rebuild images (isolated test environment) |
| `make start-prod` | Start production container and rebuild images |

> **Note:** Run all commands from the project root.  
> Containers are isolated by environment using the Docker Compose `-p` flag.

### Database Migrations (Alembic)

| Command                     | Description                                                             |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make m-create m="Message"` | Create a new migration with an autogenerated diff (replace `Message`) |
| `make m-up`   | Apply all pending migrations (upgrade to latest)                        |
| `make m-hist`   | Show the full migration history with details                           |
| `make m-current`   | Display the current migration version in the database                   |
